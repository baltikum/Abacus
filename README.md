# Gitinfo
Johnny
I worked mostly on the UI and started with making the three tabs for the application.
On the start page we where mutliple people that each worked by themself to make a button that updates textViews with different values, 
based on station. We then changed that to a spinner and again had multiple people working on the spinner by themself to select the station instead. 
I also researched low and high values with Victoria for the different sensors and fixed so that the values got different colors based on the value.
After that I worked lot with Victoria on the statitics page, where we fixed a bar graph that connects to the API.
We fixed things like color coding for different values, how the X and Y axis behave and similar things. We worked with Mattias to implement so we could
show either the last day(24 values) or the last week with the average value for the day. Then we did a lot of UI fixed where I added another constraint
so that the buttons that are in a row are centered, changed the theme color of the app, and that the graph resizes correctly when changing from last day
to last week.
