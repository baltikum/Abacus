What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to know how to make an .apk of the app. I already have it on my phone since I installed it through Android Studio to debug but would be nice to know an alternative way to get the app.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
There isn't much to do left but I could always help debug.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I was the secretary this sprint and took notes of things that we could bring to the final team reflection.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
My assignment for this week was relative small. Together with other teammembers we just debugged and tried to get the app working on a phone.
The presentation was this sprint and we were told it was not a very serious occasion, so I made an ad-like video for the app to lighten the mood.
