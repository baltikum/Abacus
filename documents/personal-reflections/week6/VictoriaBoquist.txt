-what do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn how to perfect our code in statistikFragment, get it more close to bugless

-how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
share my ideas and knowledge in UI, bargraphs and spinners

-what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
this week I were not assigned a role by the randomizer, i have been in the team meetings and trying to contribute.


-what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
me and Johnny have worked together to get rid of some minor bugs, and UI improvements to make the app look more user friendly. 
for example we changed colour of the ui from purple to light blue color, this gave a more professional look to the app
Johnny found a way to set the minimum y axis value to zero for the graph, this gave the graph a better UI look. 
Before this altercation, the graph would sometimes alter its position depending if the sensor values were missing for a button.
