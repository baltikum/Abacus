- What do I want to learn or understand better?

I want to learn how to export and run an app on a mobile phone. 

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Since we are mostly doing finishing touches ahead of wednesday's presentation and what will be the final product, like last week most work is done via team efforts. I will be in the team to test that the phone runs on a phone, and hopefully I can help with issues primarily around the map. 

- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I was Scrum Master this week, so I tried being a bit extra driving and taking the word to move things forward when there were moments of silence. 

- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

We debugged and made sure the app works on a phone, and the app was showcased on Wednesday's presentation.
