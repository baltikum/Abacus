- What do I want to learn or understand better?

I need to get a deeper understanding of how the Agile process works. We just started putting scrumboard up, setting values and
trying to figure everything out. I did Agile in a previous project but not as strict as this, mainly we used a scrumboard and set up
some socialcontract rules for meetings and so on. So even the whole weekly sprint concept is new to me, which we overlooked last project.


- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I hope to be an asset in some parts of the coding. Hopefully I can help others improve.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Ive been putting up user stories trying to divide the project together with the others. Weve been working on 
meeting times so everyones been gathered while weve been working on it. Thererfore everyone is contributing to it.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Mainly ive been looking into the open data API Göteborgs Luftkvalite.
Ive made some simple querys to fetch the right data from right stations at right times etc.
Also I tried setting up an graphical app that could parse the JSON data and display it.
