What do I want to learn or understand better?
My goal is to gain knowledge in a new programming language or a new platform (Android)
For now, I want to know how to make a simple app that just displays a string or a button.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Share my knowledge and perspective.
Contribute with what I have learned during the project.
Being active and available in the teams communication channels.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I've been helping with user-stories and taking part of the meetings.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Keeping up with the sprint assignments.
I have made basic prototype apps to get familiar with the IDE and followed guides to be prepared and take part in discussions.
