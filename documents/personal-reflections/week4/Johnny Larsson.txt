What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to understand more on how we can adjust the bar graphs for displaying the info as we want and how to color code based on different values.
Also how to use Mattias methods, that are not fully implemented yet, so that we could change what values and times we are displaying.



How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can help with UI and bar graphs and help how to implement those things.



What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I stared with using an randomizer to help assign the different roles for the week.
I have been active and helped with the Scrum board, to show how many things we checked of for the week.
I have now taken on the role of uploading the team reflection each week.


What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have worked with Victoria to implement a bar graph where it first got values from a list. 
Then I made it so we could change values and change the name on the x-axis to show for example days or months.
Then we worked with Mattias to make it change to get a list of values and times from the API so that it displays those in the graph. 
I have also made some changes to the bar graph so that it looks better.
