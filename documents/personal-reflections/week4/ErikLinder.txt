- What do I want to learn or understand better?

This week I will implement a map using Google Maps as this is the map type we decided to use, and implement it into a fragment as opposed to an activity. This will allow us to finally have a map in place and will be important to creating value for the app's product owner. 

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Some of the knowledge gained last week will be useful when me and Lukas works on getting the map to work in a fragment - something that does not look completely straight forward to accomplish. 

- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I did not get assigned a role for this week's scrum, so as usual I will be attending the meetings and like other team members give input and suggestions. I have also sent another email to the API administrators asking about their measuring values and how they are made, but received no answer. 

- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

Me and Lukas successfully implemented a working map (using Google Maps) into the app's map fragment, along with markers for the measuring stations.
