-What do I want to learn or understand better?
This week I'm assigned to implement google maps into the app. This isn't something I have done before so I will have to research a bit. I will also work together with Erik this sprint.

-How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I help if there is any questions in our group chat or on the meetings. I also work together with Erik on the map so we help eachother.
 
-What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I participated in the meetings and discussions.
 
-What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
We were able to implement the map and display the measuring stations.
