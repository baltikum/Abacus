- What do I want to learn or understand better?

In the code weve implemnted coroutines using background work to run parts of the code. This got a bit confusing implementing when using the API fetching large chunks of data so this would be good to learn more about. Probably this week I will work on a
callback listener to work with this.

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Graphical side is working intensly on the statistic tab also map part and both witll fetch data form the API. I will be available to help here.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
This week shows alot of improvement on she smaller todo cards. Also we got more KPIS in use.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Ive changed and developed the API alot to now being able to fetch data to the GUI in an effective way. 
Also Ive assisted GUI side using the API.
