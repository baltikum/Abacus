What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to make the app more user-friendly and learn what kind of design decisions are crucial to the user. (Same as last week)

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can provide another perspective.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have had more communication with the team members and attended developing sessions to keep the workflow going.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I redid the design of the startFragment and added app icon and a splash screen.
I also did some small changes/tweaks to the location code to be more informative to the user.
