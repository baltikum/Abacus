-what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
 we worked together with lukas and mattias, and got rid of one big bug which caused the app to crash often.
mattias helped us use his helper methods so we could fetch the api data.
me and Johnny have worked a lot with the charts, we have managed to change color of the bar graph based on different values,
connected the GUI with the API fetching, and implemented a working spinner for stations and buttons for the sensors,
 as well as fetch the API for last day or week depending of what the user chooses.
