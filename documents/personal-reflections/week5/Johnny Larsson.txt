What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn more about the bugs around the graphs and how to fix them until Wednesday next week:


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
As we mostly have the statistics tab left, I can help with why the problems we have are there, so that we together can fix them.


What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I stared with using an randomizer to help assign the different roles for the week.
I have been the scrum master and have been organizing and taken the lead in the meetings, and worked
hard to make sure things get done.


What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have worked with Victoria on the statistics page. Also with Mattias as he made the helper methods we needed for the graphs
and Lukas when he helped us with some crashes.
We have implemented 4 buttons for different sensor values, 2 buttons for choose last day or last week, and a spinner to choose station.
It was a lot harder then I thought with a lot of different bugs. We had to make changes in Mattias code so it didnt crash when he had null
values. We got it working with different colors for different values in the graph, that the x-axis change values and scale when we change
form last day with 24 entries, vs last week with an average for the last 7 days.
