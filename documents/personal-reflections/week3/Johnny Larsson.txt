What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to understand more about KPI and how we should use that. 
 
How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can help with showing how different UI and fragment related things work. On Friday I shoved how you build and APK that you can install on your phone to test the app there.
 
What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I stared with using an randomizer to help assign the different roles for the week.
This week I was the secretary and took notes and uploaded them to the a google docs document. 
I have also been the person that uploads the team reflections and I think I will continue with having that role. 


What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I made a spinner instead of the buttons for choosing station. As we where multiple people working on the same thing we went with Victorias solution that had a bit shorter code.
I also researched high and low levels of the different things we measure like and added color coding for those stats.
