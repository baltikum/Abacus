What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn how to integrate the app with Google Play Services.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
If we are multiple team members on the same assignment I can provide with feedback or workarounds to problems that might occurr, depending on how far I have gotten in developing.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
This sprint I was assigned the role Scrum-master and was in charge of keeping the team in check.
I made use of the social contract agreements that we had made, such as scheduled meetings and how long they would last, since we had a tendency to "talk a lot".
I think the team has now managed to go on a more structured path.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
For this sprint I developed a dropdown list for the start fragment UI instead of having multiple buttons.
Since many teammembers were working on this assignment a lot of code was similiar and we agreed to go with the simplest.
I also managed to make use of gps, however only in an empty project since it caused havoc in our app.
