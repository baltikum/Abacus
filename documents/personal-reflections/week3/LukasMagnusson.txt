-What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to continue work on the api. I also want to learn how to integrate gps and be able to compare latitude and longitude to get the shortest distance to the user.
 
-How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can help with integrating the api to the app. I also help if someone needs help or is stuck.

 
-What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I helped with how to resolve git merge conflict. I also helped when someone needed help with the code.
 
-What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I made the api more responsive and added functions to compare latitude and longitude to get the shortest distance.
