-what do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to get better at understanding how to use android studio, and especially learn more kotlin.
I didn't use much kotlin in the last sprint, since my deliverable for last sprint was a task mainly consisting of xml.
I want to learn basic syntax and understand fragments vs actions.

-how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
share my ideas and knowledge, 
actively trying to help in the group chat or other communication if someone have a problem

-what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
-i have helped with putting up user stories in the teams trello board. i have also been in the team meetings and trying to 
contribute.

-what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
i made an action in my prototype app which changed the text to what the user had typed when the user pressed the button,
this knowledge didn't however work with fragments.
the xml code worked,
