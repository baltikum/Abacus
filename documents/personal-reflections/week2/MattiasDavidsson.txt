- What do I want to learn or understand better?

I feel Ive got alot of knowledge about how to use and handle the API. But less so about the graphical parts of creating the app since I focused on the backend sofar this sprint. Next week I hope to able to either make a graphical part or maybe integrate something with backend.
I feel we got the scrumboard parts figured pretty well this week when having our supervisormeeting so thats good.
I also need to orientate myself better in Android studio, theres just an abundance of things to use / see in there and it gets confusing at times.

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I now hold alot of knowledge about the API, querying JSON parsing and those parts. So whenever a teamember needs help with that
I can definetly help out and make others learn these parts to.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I tried slicing this weeks sprint as good as I could. Breaking it into smaller pieces that could easily be divided between teammembers without any
having to wait for eachother. I was this weeks secretary and think I did a good job documenting our meetings, we had a good lookback at my notes when writing our weekly reflection.


- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Ive worked out a new way to query and fetch data form the API that is supposed to be implemented later on.
Right now the App uses Lukas version with external librarys since we had to skip my original solution that used java packages
that wasnt supported in Android studio. The new version im making will be easier for all of the team to understand, 
making all further processes using it easier for the team.
