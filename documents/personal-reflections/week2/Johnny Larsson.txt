What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to get a deeper understading of Kotlin and how to do more advanced things.
Next week I will hopefully work on something that is a bit harder. 
 
How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can help with the things I have learned about UI and fragments.

 
What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I stared with using an randomizer to help assign the different roles for the week.
In the meetings I was active and reminded people that we hadnt uploaded our team and invidual reflections.
 
What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
In the startFragment I made 6 buttons that load different text and values to some textViews.
I also looked at Lukas screen and helped him when we changed the project name in Android Studio.
