What do I want to learn or understand better?
Deeper understanding of Kotlin.
I learn the best by analyzing the teams code.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can share what I have read on and the solutions to the problems I have stumbled upon.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have been discussing the goals in the meetings. This week we assigned special roles to some team members and I did not receive one,
however next week we will switch it up and I will have a larger contribution to the scrum.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I took part in writing the reflection for this sprint and testing out button functions in fragments.
